#+title: Context

* Summary

Context can be defined as: "If a piece of information can be used to characterise the situation of a participant in an interaction, then that information is context" [[http://www.kevinli.net/courses/mobilehci_w2014/papers/dey-context-01.pdf][Understanding and Using Context]]. In that paper preceding definitions are discussed that were described as too specific. This seems to be the general consensus on that topic. Dey's definition comes from a positivist world view, though as Dourish describes in 2003. He propeses a definition coming from more of a phenomenological perspective.

* Context-Aware-Computing
** Categorization of features proposed by Dey, 2001

1. *Presentation* of information and services to a user
2. *Automatic execution* of a service for a user
3. *Tagging* of context to information to support later retrieval

* Literature
** Understanding and Using Context (Dey, 2001)

- Context defined as 'implicit situational information' (Human-Human)
- Computers not enabled to take advantage of context
- Context-Aware-Computing
- All existing definitions too specific, all existing definitions of context-aware computing too specific
- If a piece of information can be used to characterise the situation of a participant in an interaction, then that information is context
- Categorization of context-aware applications
- Collection of context data and sensing into a situation => states of relevant entities

** What we talk about when we talk about context (Dourish, 2003)
