#+title: Maker Community

* Summary

A community of people that is defined by their love of "hands-on making, creating, designing, and innovating" [[https://doi.org/10.1177%2F003172171309500306][Maker Movement Spreads Innovation One Project At A Time]]. Practices include "textile craft, robotics, cooking, woodcrafts, electronics, digital fabrication, mechanical repair, or creation â€” in short, making nearly anything". The maker community is deeply investigating in sharing knowledge, either through makerspaces and in-person sharing or online resources (see chapter Collections). Techniques like [[file:20201230222142-3d_printing.org][3D Printing]] are often used to create something completly new.
